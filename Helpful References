Interactive Tools for Learning HTTP

A good way to learn HTTP is to experiment with creating requests and viewing their responses. 
The Hurl.it app makes it easy to experiment with HTTP requests:
An HTTP request generator: http://www.hurl.it/

You can also install different browser extensions to manually construct HTTP requests:
Postman for Chrome:
